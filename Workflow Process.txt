The project github repository has been protected against 'push' requests to the master branch.

In addition to this we will be adopting a few practices to help our workflow.

1) We will create a branch off the master, which will be the 'Development Branch'
2) Any/All features that need to be implemented will begin as branches off of 'Development Branch'
3) Once a feature has been successfully implemented AND TESTED the branch owner may make a pull request to merge their feature into 'Development Branch'
4) The pull request must then be reviewed and approved by TWO other team members before being merged
5) Additional testing/review will be required before pull requesting the final product to master.

On the occasion that merge conflicts occur, the person making the pull request must attempt to resolve the conflict.  If no safe solution seems viable,
the person making the request must then contact the author of the previous code and together they must work to resolve the conlict.
If no agreement is made then a third person will deligate and a majority rule will decide how the conflict will be handled.
