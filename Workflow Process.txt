The project github repository has been protected against 'push' requests to the master branch.

Dev's take the following steps to contribute to the repository
1)Create a new branch
2)Make changes on the newly made branch
3)Can 'push' branch to repo for others to see
4)Make a 'pull' request to get approval from at least one other member to merge the branch into the master branch

Taking this precaution forces all project developers to make changes in their own branch before requesting a merge.

On the occasion that merge conflicts occur, the person making the pull request must communicate with the author
of the code currently in conflict, and together they must decide on a conflict resolution plan.
